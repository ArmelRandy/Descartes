    "The goal of this project is to predict the content of the column $TARGET\\_FLAG$ given some attributes. It is a categorical variable so we are facing a classification problem (more precisely binary classificatoin). The distribution between the 2 classes is not balanced, it is something that we will have in mind when choosing the evaluation metric. For example, the AUC and the f1-score will be preferred to accuracy. In order to solve the problem we are going to perform data exploration, data cleaning and processing and finally model selection. At the end of this process we will have a baseline solution with many improvements possible."
